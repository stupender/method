# LEARNED.md — concepts log

One line per new concept, in build order. This is the running record that
becomes `STUDY_GUIDE.md` in the final teaching session. Newest at the bottom.

## Session 1 — skeleton & schema

- **Vite** — the dev server + build tool; `npm run dev` runs a live-reloading
  local server, `npm run build` makes the static site in `dist/`.
- **React component** — a function that returns the UI (JSX). `App` is the top
  one; `main.tsx` mounts it into the page's `<div id="root">`.
- **TypeScript `type` / `interface`** — a contract describing the shape of data.
  If data doesn't match, the build complains before the app runs. Our whole
  schema (`src/theory/types.ts`) is types with no logic.
- **Data-driven architecture** — the engine renders DATA; theory content lives
  in `src/data/`. Add content by adding a data file, not by changing code.
- **Layering** — data → theory logic → rendering → audio → UI, kept separate so
  each part stays simple and the app scales by adding data.
- **Pure function** — same inputs always give the same output, no side effects.
  The theory logic will be pure functions, which are easy to test and reason
  about.
- **Modelling notes** — a note carries both how it SOUNDS (pitch class 0–11) and
  how it's SPELLED (letter + accidental), so enharmonics stay correct.
- **Interval as the unit of theory** — scales/chords are a root + a list of
  intervals; each interval stores letter-distance AND semitone-distance.
- **Parameterising the instrument** — the fretboard takes an `Instrument` +
  `Tuning` as data, so it never assumes "guitar"; ukulele is just other data.
- **CSS variables** — the colour palette is defined once in `:root` and reused,
  so the whole mood can be retuned in one place.
- **GitHub Pages deploy** — `vite.config.ts` `base` must equal the repo name;
  `npm run deploy` (the `gh-pages` package) publishes `dist/` to the live site.
